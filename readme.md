# Reviews Site

Module 5 Graded Project (Flex-Fall-2018)

## Objective

Using Spring / Thymeleaf / HTML, test-drive the creation of a Reviews site (of the student's choosing).  Pages should consist of an overview of all reviews available, and one for diving into a specific review.

Each review object should have at least the following items
* id
* title
* image url (saved to resources/static/images folder)
* review category
* applicable content

Potentially add (based on items being reviewed):
* date of review
* description / synopsis of reviewed item
* tags (in the form of a collection)

You will need a ReviewRepository Class, and a ReviewController Class
